SD_RFC_CUSTOMER_GET is an RFC-enabled function module that should be present in every SAP system. It is designed for demonstration purposes. As an import parameter, a customer number should be transferred to the module and the customer's address is sent back to the calling program contained in a table parameter.
The code below shows how to log on to the SAP system. An RFCFunction object is created by the method CreateFunction.
The import parameter KUNNR is filled with the string given by the user. Execute() executes the function module.

After the call, the program loops through the table CUSTOMER_T and writes some columns to the console.
