The Table Join component allows to join many tables (and views) on the SAP side and to extract the result.  

It is required to install a custom funktion module on the SAP server to be able to use this component.  
For a manual installation of the custom function use the setp-by-step guide in our [Knowledgebase article](). 
Alternatively you can use the transport (zip file), that can be found in the ABAP subfolder of the installation folder, to install the function module.
